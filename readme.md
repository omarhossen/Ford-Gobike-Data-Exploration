## Dataset

the dataset contains 183412 trips with features vary from trip information such as trip duration and start time      
and member information such as birth year, gender,usertype.


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that:

1-there is a relationship between trip duration(feature of interest) and gender     
males make faster trips than females and others so the average trip duration of males is less than females and others
    
2-there is a relationship between trip duration(feature of interest) and user type   
customers making long trips than subscribers as they make a trip for a special task

3-there is a relationship between trip duration(feature of interest)and day of week   
long trips occur in weekend days such as saturday and sunday as people go for      entertainment   
    
4-there is a relationship between trip duration(feature of interest)and part of day 
long trips occur in morning and afternoon part of day as people go and back from thier work and school
     
5-there is a relationship between trip duration(feature of interest)and age buckets long trips are made by seniors then adults and shortest trips made by youth
as the level of fittness of youth is higher than adults and seniors

I verified the relationship between the categorical such as:
1-most of trips are made by subscribers in all day of week   
2-most of trips are made by males in all day of week   
3-the most of genders are subscribers members   



## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the following two parts :
 1- the distributions and percentages of the main variable and other interested features such as :
 a-trip duration distribution
 b-member age distribution
 c-percentage of each user type
 d-percentage of each gender
 
 
2- relationships between  two features with the main variable of interest such as

a-the relationship between trip duration(feature of interest)and day parts accorrding to user type
long trips occur in morning and afternoon part of the day
and trip duration for customer are more than subscriber member for all parts of day

b-the relationship between trip duration(feature of interest)and age buckets according to gender
for all age buckets males make the faster trips
and other make the slowest trips
except for youth females make the slowest trips

c-the relationship between trip duration(feature of interest)and day of week according to age buckets 
long trips occur at the weekend days such as saturday and sunday
and for most days youth trips are faster and adults make slower trips while seniors make the slowest trips
except monday and thursday trips duration of adults and youth are close to each other
